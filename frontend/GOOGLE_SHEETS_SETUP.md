# Google Sheets Contact Form Integration Setup - UPDATED v2

## ⚠️ Critical Issue: Form Says Success But No Data in Sheet

If you're seeing "Message sent successfully" but no data appears in your Google Sheet, follow these detailed steps:

## Step 1: Update Google Apps Script (REQUIRED)

1. Open your Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FE-OpK1oUC_W2-Kc3anKUMZns0dbQvwRmDqHg36vTRk/edit
2. Click on `Extensions` → `Apps Script`
3. **Delete ALL existing code** and replace with the updated code from `google-apps-script.gs`
4. Save the project (Ctrl+S)
5. **Important**: Run the `testAddData()` function to verify permissions:
   - Select `testAddData` from the function dropdown
   - Click the ▶️ Run button
   - Authorize the script when prompted
   - Check if test data appears in your sheet

## Step 2: Proper Deployment Steps

1. In Apps Script editor, click `Deploy` → `New Deployment` (create a fresh one)
2. Click the gear icon next to "Type" and select `Web app`
3. **Critical Settings**:
   - Description: "Contact Form Handler v2"
   - Execute as: **"Me"** (your email address)
   - Who has access: **"Anyone"**
4. Click `Deploy`
5. **Copy the NEW Web App URL**
6. **Update your React code** with the new URL

## Step 3: Verify Permissions

1. Test the script URL directly in a browser:
   - Paste your Web App URL in browser
   - You should see: "Contact form handler is working! Timestamp: [date]"
2. If you get permission errors:
   - Go back to Apps Script
   - Click on the ⚠️ icon next to `testAddData`
   - Grant all requested permissions

## Step 4: Debug the Integration

The updated React component now includes detailed logging. To debug:

1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Submit the form
4. Check for error messages or logs

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Script Not Authorized
**Symptoms**: 200 OK response but no data
**Fix**: Run `testAddData()` function in Apps Script and grant permissions

### Issue 2: Wrong Sheet Access
**Symptoms**: Script runs but writes to wrong sheet
**Fix**: The updated script uses specific spreadsheet ID

### Issue 3: Deployment Issues
**Symptoms**: Old cached version running
**Fix**: Create a completely new deployment with new URL

**Fix**: Ensure "Execute as: Me" and "Access: Anyone" in deployment

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. Form submission shows detailed logs in browser console
2. Google Apps Script execution appears in Apps Script → Executions
3. Data appears in your Google Sheet immediately
4. Success message shows in form
